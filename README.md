# Inference on biological sequence data

This is a graded numerical mini-project of BIO-369: Randomness and information in biological data in EPFL, 2024 Spring. Click [here](https://edu.epfl.ch/studyplan/en/bachelor/life-sciences-engineering/coursebook/randomness-and-information-in-biological-data-BIO-369) to visit the course website.

### Summary
Biology is becoming more and more a data science, as illustrated by the explosion of available genome sequences. This course aims to show how we can make sense of such data and harness it in order to understand biological processes in a quantitative way.
